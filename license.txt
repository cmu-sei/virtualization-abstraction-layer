END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
3. VMware SDK (https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vc-sdk/index.html) Copyright 2018 VMWare, Inc..
VMware® vSphere Software Development Kit License Agreement
VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) provides the VMware vSphere Software Development Kit (collectively the “Software”) to you subject to the following terms and conditions. By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you (the individual or legal entity) agree to be bound by the terms of this license agreement (the “Agreement”). If you disagree with any of the following terms, then do not use the Software. 
1. The Software contains a variety of materials, interface definitions, documentation, sample utility applications and sample code regarding programming interfaces to one or more VMware products that are referenced in such materials (the referenced products, “VMware Products”). This Software is intended to be used to develop software that interacts with the VMware Products. 
2. Use Rights: Subject to the restrictions below, you may download and make a reasonable number of copies of the Software for your use solely for the purpose of creating software that communicates with VMware Products (your software, “Developer Software”). Some code may be designated as “distributable code” and/or “modifiable code” at http://www.vmware.com/go/vwssdk-redistribution-info . You may use and merge all or portions of the “distributable code” with your Developer Software. Any merged portion of any “distributable code” is subject to this Agreement. Additionally, you may modify or create derivative works of all or portions of the “modifiable code.” You are permitted to re-distribute the “distributable code” and the modified or derivative works of the “modifiable code” only as part of your Developer Software for non-commercial or commercial use; provided that you shall only distribute such code subject to a license agreement that protects VMware’s and its licensors’ interests consistent with the terms contained in this Agreement. Open source software components provided with the Software are licensed to you under the terms of the applicable license agreements included with such open source software components. The open source software licenses can be found in the open_source_licenses.txt file, other materials accompanying the Software, the documentation or corresponding source files available at http://www.vmware.com/download/open_source.html.
3. Restrictions: You agree that you will not (1) use the Software to create, design or develop anything other than Developer Software; (2) make any more copies of the Software than are reasonably necessary for the authorized use and backup and archival purposes; (3) modify, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or disassemble the Software except as expressly permitted in Section 2; (4) distribute, sell, lease, rent, lend, or sublicense any part of the Software to any third party except as expressly permitted in Section 2; or (5) use the Software in any manner to (a) circumvent any technical restrictions of VMware Products or violate any additional licensing terms applicable to VMware Products that VMware provides through product documentation, email notification on the VMware website or in the terms of the End User License Agreements; (b) disable, remove, over-ride or modify the display of any VMware Product End User License Agreements that the VMware Products present to the end customers; or (c) upload or otherwise transmit any material containing software viruses or other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any software or hardware. 
The restrictions in this Section 3 shall not apply if and to the extent they contradict mandatory local law (including, but not limited to, law implementing the EC Software Directive).
4. VMware retains ownership of the Software and all intellectual property rights embodied in the Software, including without limitation all copyrights, trade secrets and patents. You may not remove, delete or modify any of VMware copyright statements in the Software. ALL RIGHTS NOT EXPRESSLY GRANTED HEREUNDER ARE RESERVED TO VMWARE.
5. You may not use VMware’s name, trademarks or service marks in connection with your Developer Software in a way that suggests your Developer Software is certified or endorsed by VMware. 
6. You are not entitled under this Agreement to receive any VMware support or subscription services for the Software or any other services from VMware in connection with the Software. If you have purchased support and/or subscription services for a VMware product, such support and/or subscription services shall not apply to the Software or your use of the Software. 
7. Term, Termination and Changes: This Agreement shall continue as long as you are in compliance with the terms specified herein or until otherwise terminated. You or VMware each may terminate this Agreement for any reason at any time. You agree, upon termination, to destroy all copies of the Software within your possession or control. The Confidential Information, Limitations of Warranties and Liability, and Indemnification sections set out in this Agreement shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.
8. Confidential Information: “Confidential Information” means any information disclosed by VMware to you pursuant to this Agreement that is marked “Confidential,” “Proprietary,” or in some similar manner and any information which you knew or reasonably should have known to be confidential. You shall treat as confidential all Confidential Information of VMware and shall not use such Confidential Information except to exercise your rights or perform your obligations under this Agreement. You will protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as you protect your own confidential or proprietary information of a similar nature but with no less than reasonable care. You shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party during or after the term of this Agreement. This paragraph will not apply to any Confidential Information that: (a) was rightfully in your possession prior to receipt of such Confidential Information from VMware; (b) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of you; (c) is rightfully received from a third party without a duty of confidentiality; (d) is independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligations; (e) is disclosed by you with VMware’s prior written approval; or (f) you are required to disclose by applicable law or court order, provided that you notify VMware of such required disclosure promptly in writing and cooperate with VMware in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure. You acknowledge that breach of this Section 8 will cause irreparable damage to VMware for which monetary damages will be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, VMware will be entitled to seek and obtain injunctive and any other relief (legal or equitable) to restrain any breach or anticipated breach of this Section 8.
9. Limitations of Warranties and Liability: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, VMWARE DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL VMWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSE¬QUEN¬TIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE SOFTWARE OR YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE PRECEDING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
VMWARE’S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE SOFTWARE PROVIDED HEREUNDER WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED US$100.00.
THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER VMWARE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
10. Indemnification: You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless VMware, and any of its directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents, from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities and other expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), arising from your modification of the “modifiable code,” the distribution or use of your Developer Software by you or anyone else, and your breach of this Agreement.
11. Export Control: You acknowledge that the Software is of United States origin, is provided subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, may be subject to the export control laws of the applicable territory, and that diversion contrary to applicable export control laws is prohibited. You represent, warrant and covenant that (1) you are not, and are not acting on behalf of, (a) any person who is a citizen, national, or resident of, or who is controlled by the government of any country to which the United States has prohibited export transactions; or (b) any person or entity listed on the U.S. Treasury Department list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, or the U.S. Commerce Department Denied Persons List or Entity List; and (2) you will not permit the Software to be used for any purposes prohibited by law, including, any prohibited development, design, manufacture or production of missiles or nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
12. Data Privacy:
(a)Consent for Collection and Use of Technical Data. You agree that VMware may periodically collect, process and store technical and related information about your device, system, application, peripherals and your use of the Software, including without limitation: internet protocol address, hardware identification, operating system, application software, peripheral hardware, number of active plugins and software development kits, the successful installation and launch of Software, and Software usage statistics (collectively, “Technical Data”). VMware will use Technical Data for internal statistical and analytical purposes to facilitate support, invoicing or online services, the provisioning of updates, and the development of VMware products and services. VMware may transfer Technical Data to other companies in the VMware worldwide group of companies from time to time.
(b)Log Files. You acknowledge that correspondence and log files generated in conjunction with a request for support services may contain sensitive, confidential or personal information. You are solely responsible for taking the steps necessary to protect such data, including obfuscating the logs or otherwise guarding such information prior to sending it to VMware.
13. These terms are governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States of America without regard to conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply. You may not assign this Agreement. Any attempted assignment by you shall be void. These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and VMware with respect to the Software and supersede all prior written or oral communications, understandings and agreements. Any waiver of these terms must be in writing and signed by the waiving party to be effective. If any provision of these terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining terms will continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
